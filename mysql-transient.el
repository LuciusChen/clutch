;; Transient-based dispatch menus (Magit-style) for mysql-interactive.
;; Provides `mysql-dispatch' as the main entry point.
;;
;; Usage:
;;   (require 'mysql-transient)
;;   ;; Then: M-x mysql-dispatch
;;   ;; Or bind in mysql-mode:
;;   ;;   (define-key mysql-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-c") #'mysql-dispatch)

;;; Code:

(require 'transient)
(require 'mysql-interactive)

;;;###autoload (autoload 'mysql-dispatch "mysql-transient" nil t)
